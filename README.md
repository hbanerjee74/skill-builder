# Skill Builder

A multi-agent workflow for creating Anthropic Claude skills — domain knowledge packages that help data/analytics engineers build silver and gold layer models. Available as a **CLI workflow** (Claude Code / Claude Desktop) and a **desktop application** (Tauri).

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | How to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CLI** (Claude Code) | Production | Say "start" in a Claude Code session |
| **CLI** (Claude Desktop Cowork) | Production | Say "start" in a Cowork session — see `cowork/cowork.md` |
| **Desktop App** (Tauri) | In development (`feature/desktop-ui`) | See [Desktop App](#desktop-app) below |

Both CLI platforms run the same 9-step workflow orchestrated by the coordinator in `CLAUDE.md`. The desktop app replaces the CLI with a GUI — workflow dashboard, form-based Q&A, streaming agent output, and a chat interface for post-build editing.

## Workflow Overview

| Step | What Happens | Your Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Initialization** | Choose a domain and skill name | Provide domain, confirm name |
| **Step 1** | Research agent identifies key entities, metrics, KPIs | Wait |
| **Step 2** | Review domain concept questions | Answer each question |
| **Step 3** | Orchestrator spawns parallel research + merge sub-agents | Wait |
| **Step 4** | Review merged clarification questions | Answer each question |
| **Step 5** | Reasoning agent analyzes answers, finds gaps/contradictions | Confirm reasoning, answer follow-ups |
| **Step 6** | Build agent creates the skill files | Review skill output |
| **Step 7** | Validator checks against best practices | Review validation log |
| **Step 8** | Tester generates and runs test prompts | Review test results |
| **Step 9** | Package into a `.skill` zip archive | Done |

## CLI Workflow

### Agent Prompt Files

Each prompt file defines a single agent's behavior. The coordinator spawns them as teammates at the right step.

| File | Agent | Model Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-research-domain-concepts.md` | Domain concepts researcher | sonnet |
| `03a-research-business-patterns.md` | Business patterns researcher | sonnet |
| `03b-research-data-modeling.md` | Data modeling researcher | sonnet |
| `04-merge-clarifications.md` | Question deduplicator/merger | haiku |
| `06-reasoning-agent.md` | Reasoning + decision engine | opus |
| `07-build-agent.md` | Skill file creator | sonnet |
| `08-validate-agent.md` | Best practices validator | sonnet |
| `09-test-agent.md` | Test prompt generator + evaluator | sonnet |

### Session Resume

The CLI workflow supports resuming from any step. State is tracked in `skills/<skillname>/workflow-state.md`. On restart, you'll be asked whether to continue or reset.

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** or **Claude Desktop** (Cowork mode) with access to sonnet, haiku, and opus models
- All files in this project folder

## Desktop App

The desktop app (`app/`) is a **Tauri v2** application that provides a GUI for the skill builder workflow. It's in active development on the `feature/desktop-ui` branch.

### Why Tauri

- ~10MB binary vs 150MB+ Electron
- Rust backend for fast file I/O, SQLite persistence, secure API key storage
- Tauri events for streaming Claude API responses to the UI
- API keys stay in the Rust backend, never in the webview

### Tech Stack

**Frontend** (React + TypeScript in Tauri webview):

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite 7 |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui (Radix + Tailwind CSS 4) |
| State | Zustand |
| Routing | TanStack Router |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod |
| Markdown | react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-highlight |

**Backend** (Rust / Tauri):

| Module | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP | reqwest (streaming SSE for Claude API) |
| File watching | notify |
| Markdown parsing | pulldown-cmark |
| Settings | rusqlite (SQLite) |

### Key UI Views

1. **Dashboard** — Grid of skill cards with progress, actions (Continue/Reset/Delete), "+ New Skill"
2. **Workflow Wizard** — Step progression sidebar, streaming agent output, form-based Q&A for review steps
3. **Chat Interface** — Conversational editing and review+suggest modes for post-build refinement
4. **Skill Editor** — Three-pane layout: file tree, CodeMirror source editor, live markdown preview
5. **Settings** — Anthropic API key, workspace folder, Node.js status

### Development

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Prerequisites: Node.js, Rust toolchain, platform-specific Tauri dependencies (see [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)).

### Testing

```bash
cd app

# Frontend unit tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
npm test

# Rust unit + integration tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test

# E2E tests (Playwright — launches Vite dev server automatically)
npm run test:e2e
```

See `CLAUDE.md` for full testing documentation including mock strategies and the testing rule for new features.
