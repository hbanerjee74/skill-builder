Design a REST API extraction strategy for Salesforce Opportunity data that captures the full sales pipeline for analytics. Include handling of standard fields (Amount, Stage, CloseDate, Probability), custom fields for PS/MS deal types and engagement models, and related objects (Account, Contact, OpportunityLineItem). Address SOQL query limits, field-level security filtering, and incremental extraction using SystemModstamp with proper pagination.
---
Create a custom object extraction approach for a PS/MS company's "Project__c" custom object that tracks post-sale delivery. Design the SOQL queries to handle custom fields, lookup relationships to Account and Opportunity, and picklist values for project status and service type. Include strategies for handling record types, formula fields in analytics contexts, and managing API governor limits when extracting large custom object datasets.
---
Design a relationship mapping strategy for extracting interconnected Salesforce objects (Account, Contact, Opportunity, OpportunityContactRole, Task, Event) into a dimensional model for analytics. Address how to handle lookup vs master-detail relationships, polymorphic relationships (WhoId, WhatId), and junction objects. Include considerations for denormalization decisions, handling deleted records via IsDeleted flag, and maintaining referential integrity across incremental loads.
---
Build a change data capture strategy for incremental Salesforce extraction using REST API that handles both new and modified records. Design an approach using SystemModstamp for standard objects and LastModifiedDate for custom objects, including handling of hard deletes via getDeleted() API, managing extraction windows to avoid data loss, and dealing with Salesforce's 30-day deleted record retention. Address how to handle bulk updates that might exceed API limits and ensure idempotent loads.
---
Create a data quality validation framework for Salesforce extractions that addresses SFDC-specific data issues in analytics contexts. Include validation for required fields vs null values (considering field-level security), picklist value changes over time, currency field handling with multi-currency orgs, handling of rich text and long text area fields, and validation of lookup relationship integrity. Address how to detect and handle record type changes, merged records, and data skew issues common in SFDC objects like Account and Opportunity.
