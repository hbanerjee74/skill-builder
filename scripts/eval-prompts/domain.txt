Design a silver-layer lead scoring model for a cloud services company that transforms raw CRM lead data into analytics-ready lead quality metrics. Starting from bronze tables (leads, lead_sources, lead_activities, web_sessions), create a silver model that calculates lead scores based on engagement signals (form fills, content downloads, demo requests), firmographic fit (company size, industry, technology stack), and behavioral patterns (page views, email opens, time on site). How should you handle leads with incomplete data, define scoring weights that balance predictive power with business intuition, and structure the model to support both point-in-time snapshots and historical trend analysis?

Build a gold-layer opportunity pipeline analytics model that aggregates silver-layer opportunity, account, and product data into executive-ready sales metrics. Transform normalized silver tables (opportunities, opportunity_line_items, accounts, products, sales_reps) into a gold fact table with pre-calculated KPIs: pipeline value by stage, weighted pipeline (probability-adjusted), average deal size by segment, sales cycle length, and win rate by rep/product/region. How should you handle opportunities that span multiple quarters, define stage progression logic that accounts for deals moving backward, and implement slowly changing dimensions for historical comparisons when territory assignments or product categories change?

Design a silver-layer conversion funnel model that tracks prospect progression through sales stages with proper attribution and timing logic. Starting from bronze event data (lead_created, lead_qualified, opportunity_created, proposal_sent, deal_closed), build a silver model that calculates stage conversion rates, time-in-stage metrics, and identifies conversion bottlenecks. How should you handle leads that skip stages, attribute conversions when multiple touchpoints occur simultaneously, implement lookback windows for attribution (first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch), and structure the model to support cohort analysis by lead source and time period?

Create a gold-layer sales capacity and quota attainment model that combines silver-layer sales rep data with territory assignments and quota targets. Transform silver tables (sales_reps, territories, quota_assignments, bookings, pipeline) into a gold model showing quota attainment percentage, pipeline coverage ratio (pipeline value / remaining quota), forecast accuracy (predicted vs actual bookings), and capacity utilization (active deals per rep vs optimal load). How should you handle mid-quarter territory changes, pro-rate quotas for new hires or departures, and implement rolling forecasts that update as the quarter progresses?

Design a silver-layer customer health score model that transforms raw product usage, support, and billing data into actionable retention signals. Starting from bronze tables (product_usage_events, support_tickets, invoices, contract_renewals, customer_contacts), create a silver model that calculates health scores based on usage trends (active users, feature adoption, login frequency), support patterns (ticket volume, severity, resolution time), payment behavior (on-time payments, disputes, downgrades), and engagement signals (executive meetings, QBR attendance, NPS scores). How should you weight different health factors, handle customers with seasonal usage patterns, define thresholds that trigger alerts, and structure the model to support both current health snapshots and predictive churn risk scoring?
