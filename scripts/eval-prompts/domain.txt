Build an opportunity management system for a professional services firm selling cloud migration projects (AWS/Azure). Define deal stages from initial discovery through contract signature, including required artifacts per stage, exit criteria, and forecasting confidence levels. How should you handle multi-phase engagements where Phase 1 is committed but Phase 2-3 are speculative?

Create a deal progression analysis framework for a managed services provider with 50-200 active opportunities. Design metrics to identify conversion bottlenecks between stages (discovery → proposal → negotiation → close), calculate stage velocity, and flag at-risk deals. What leading indicators predict deal slippage in PS/MS sales cycles?

Design a territory and quota allocation model for a cloud services company with 8 account executives selling both project-based professional services ($50K-$500K deals) and recurring managed services ($5K-$50K MRR). How should quotas balance new logo acquisition vs account expansion, and how do you fairly distribute territories when some verticals (fintech, healthcare) have higher deal density?

Build a customer relationship tracking system for a managed services provider managing 80 active client accounts with multiple stakeholders per account. Define relationship strength scoring (executive sponsor, technical champion, economic buyer), engagement cadence requirements, and escalation triggers for at-risk accounts. How should the system track multi-threading across organizations and identify white space expansion opportunities?
