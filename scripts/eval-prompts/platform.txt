Design an incremental model strategy in dbt for a large event fact table that uses the merge incremental strategy, handles late-arriving data with a lookback window, and includes data contracts to enforce schema and freshness requirements.
---
Create a comprehensive testing strategy for a dbt project that combines unit tests for transformation logic, data tests for quality checks, and data contracts at model boundaries to prevent breaking changes downstream.
---
Build a reusable dbt macro package for standardizing data quality checks across multiple projects, including parameterized tests for null rates, uniqueness thresholds, and referential integrity with proper documentation and versioning.
---
Design a multi-environment deployment strategy for dbt that uses CI/CD pipelines to run slim CI on pull requests, deploy to staging with full refresh capability, and promote to production with blue-green deployment patterns.
---
Implement a documentation strategy in dbt that leverages auto-generated lineage graphs, custom metadata in schema.yml files, and dbt-docs to create a searchable data catalog with business context and ownership information.
