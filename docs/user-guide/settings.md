## Marketplace

### Registries

A table of GitHub repository URLs used as skill sources. Each row shows the URL, an **Enabled** toggle, a connectivity test icon, and a delete button (built-in registries cannot be removed).

**How to add a registry**

1. Click **Add registry**.
2. Enter a GitHub URL (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/skill-library`) in the **GitHub URL** field.
3. Click **Add**. The app fetches the registry's `marketplace.json` to validate it. On success, the registry appears in the table.
4. Click **Cancel** to dismiss without adding.

**How to enable or disable a registry**
Toggle the **Enabled** switch on the registry row. Disabled registries are excluded from Marketplace browsing.

**How to remove a registry**
Click the trash icon on the row. Built-in registries have no trash icon and cannot be removed.

### Auto-update

Toggle **Automatically apply updates from all enabled registries at startup** to have the app pull registry updates each time it launches.
