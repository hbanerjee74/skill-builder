## What's on this screen

**Summary cards** (top row)

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Total Spent (USD) | Cumulative API cost across all runs |
| Total Runs | Number of workflow agent runs |
| Avg Cost/Run | Average cost per individual agent run |

**Cost by Step** bar chart — lists each workflow step (Research, Detailed Research, Confirm Decisions, Generate Skill) with total cost, agent run count, and a proportional bar.

**Cost by Model** bar chart — same breakdown grouped by Claude model.

**Recent Workflow Runs** list — each row shows:

- Skill name

Click any row to expand it and see a per-step breakdown: step name, model badge, cost, and tokens.
