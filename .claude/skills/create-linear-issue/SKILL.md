# Create Linear Issue

Turn a short product thought into a clear, product-level Linear issue.

## Codex Execution Mode

See `../../rules/codex-execution-policy.md`.

## Tool Contract

Use these exact tools:

- `mcp__linear__list_issues`: dedupe search and child discovery
- `mcp__linear__get_issue`: fetch parent issue for decomposition
- `mcp__linear__list_projects`: project selection
- `mcp__linear__get_project`: fetch full project details
- `mcp__linear__list_milestones`: milestone discovery for selected project
- `mcp__linear__list_issue_labels`: label selection
- `mcp__linear__save_issue`: create/update issue(s)
- `mcp__linear__create_comment`: optional rationale notes on parent

Required fields:

- New issue via `save_issue`: `team`, `title`; include `description`, `project`, `labels`, `estimate`, `assignee: "me"` when available.
- Decomposition child issue: must include parent reference in description and AC mapping.

Fallback behavior:

- If required Linear tools are unavailable or failing after one retry, stop and report missing capability. Do not fabricate IDs, labels, or project names.

## Core Rules

1. Product-level only. No file names, component names, or architecture in issue body.
2. Confirm before creating. Always show final issue draft before `save_issue`.
3. Clarifications: ask at most 2 targeted questions. If confidence is high (>=80%), default assumptions and proceed.
4. Idempotency: re-runs must not duplicate equivalent issues/comments. Reuse discovered open issue when appropriate.
5. Acceptance criteria in Linear must use Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ] ...`).
6. Resolve the target project from repo policy in `AGENTS.md` (Issue Management section). Do not hardcode a project name in this skill.
7. Milestone selection must be from the resolved project only. If no clear milestone match exists, ask the user before creating the issue.
8. Do not decompose by implementation layer (`frontend`/`backend`/`API`). Issues must represent integrated, user-visible outcomes that can be validated end-to-end.
9. Decomposition is allowed only by feature slices. Frontend-only splits are allowed only when each split is an independently testable feature outcome.

## Outcomes

- Request understood (feature, bug, or decompose)
- Requirements drafted and estimate confirmed
- Issue created (or child issues created) with traceable ACs

## Understand the Request

- If user intent is decompose (e.g., `break down <issue-id>`), follow **Decompose Path**.
- Otherwise classify as `feature` or `bug`.

## Dedupe Check (required)

Before creating any issue:

1. Search open issues with `list_issues` using title/keyword query.
2. If a near-duplicate exists, present it and ask whether to reuse/update instead of creating a new one.

## Issue Schema (required)

Use this description template:

```md
## Problem
...

## Goal
...

## Non-goals
- ...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

## Risks
- ...

## Test Notes
- ...
```

## Estimate

See `references/linear-operations.md` for estimate table.

- `L` is the maximum single-issue size.
- If scope exceeds `L`, switch to decomposition.

## Project And Milestone Resolution (required)

Before drafting or creating an issue:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and resolve the project policy from **Issue Management**.
2. Use `list_projects`/`get_project` to resolve the Linear project ID/name from that policy.
3. Use `list_milestones` for that project and map feature intent to milestone candidates.
4. If exactly one milestone is a clear match, include it in the draft.
5. If none or multiple plausible matches, ask the user which milestone to use before `save_issue`.
6. Never pick a milestone from a different project.

## Create Path

1. Resolve project from `AGENTS.md` policy and fetch labels.
2. Resolve milestone candidates from that project.
3. Draft title, estimate, project, milestone (if resolved), labels, description (schema above).
4. Confirm draft with user.
5. Create with `mcp__linear__save_issue` (`assignee: "me"` when allowed).
6. Return issue ID + URL.

## Decompose Path

1. Fetch parent issue, resolve project from `AGENTS.md` policy, and fetch labels.
2. Split into 2-4 child issues, each <= `L`.
3. Traceability rule: each child maps to exactly one AC group from parent.
4. Resolve milestone candidates from the resolved project; if unclear, ask user before create.
5. Confirm child plan with user.
6. Create children with `save_issue` in parallel when safe.
7. Update parent description to list child IDs and AC-group mapping.

## Output Hygiene

- Never inline long command/test output into Linear issue fields.
- Keep Linear description concise and product-facing.
