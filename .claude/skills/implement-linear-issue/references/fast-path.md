# Fast Path — Small Issues

## When to Use

Use when ALL are true:
- Estimate is XS or S (1-2 points)
- Changes are isolated to one area of the codebase
- User can override in either direction

## How It Works

Skip team orchestration. Spawn a **single `general-purpose` sub-agent** that implements, updates/adds/removes tests as needed, commits, pushes, and checks off ACs on Linear. The agent must read existing tests before writing any — update broken tests, remove redundant ones, and only add tests for genuinely new behavior. If tests were added, removed, or renamed, update `app/tests/TEST_MANIFEST.md` to keep the source-to-test mapping current.

Proceed directly to **Phase 5 (Code Review)**. Code review and PR creation are never skipped.

Phase 9 Linear updates still apply — write what was done, tests, and PR link.
