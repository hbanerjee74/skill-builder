# Git and PR Conventions

## PR Body Template

Title: `<issue-id>: short description`

```markdown
Fixes <issue-id>

<!-- If the PR covers child issues, list EACH on its own line: -->
<!-- Fixes VD-530 -->
<!-- Fixes VD-531 -->
<!-- Fixes VD-532 -->
<!-- NEVER group as "Fixes VD-530/531/532" — each must be a separate line. -->

## Test Plan Guidelines

The test plan section is **checked during `/close-issue`** — unchecked items block the merge.

- **Automated tests**: Mark `[x]` immediately after tests pass. Include test counts.
- **Manual tests**: Leave `[ ]` unchecked. The user checks these off on the PR after manual testing.
- Write manual test items as concrete steps the user can follow (action → expected result).
- Cover every user-visible behavior change — not internals.

After creating the PR, link it to the Linear issue via `linear-server:update_issue`.

## Worktree Preservation

**Do NOT remove the worktree.** The user tests manually on it. Include the worktree path in the final status report.
