# Type configuration for source agents
NAME_PREFIX=source

# Focus lines for research sub-agents (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_entities=Focus on API entities, their relationships, and source-specific data structures.
FOCUS_LINE__research_metrics=Focus on data quality metrics, API rate limits, and extraction success measurements.
FOCUS_LINE__research_practices=Focus on extraction patterns, API rate limit handling, webhook vs. polling trade-offs, and data delivery edge cases.
FOCUS_LINE__research_implementation=Focus on API schema mapping, data type coercion, schema evolution handling, and source-specific data quality gotchas.

# Entity examples (used in research-entities template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for Stripe: charges, subscriptions, events; for Salesforce: accounts, opportunities, custom objects

# Skill type identifier
SKILL_TYPE=source

# Research dimensions — all spawn in parallel
DIMENSIONS=entities,data-quality,extraction,field-semantics,lifecycle-and-state,reconciliation

# Per-dimension focus overrides (optional — omit to use dimension's default focus)
DIMENSION_FOCUS__entities=Custom objects, managed package objects, record type subdivisions, and non-standard relationships that depart from the platform's standard object model. Do NOT enumerate standard objects Claude already knows. Include installed managed packages, their schema extensions, standard field overrides, and package update impact.
DIMENSION_FOCUS__data_quality=Known data quality issues in the customer's source system: fields that are commonly null or unreliable, validation rules that force incorrect data entry, data cleanup jobs or compensating controls, quality expectations for downstream consumers
DIMENSION_FOCUS__extraction=Identify platform-specific extraction traps (multi-tenant filtering, governor limits at scale, permission/scope affecting completeness), CDC field selection (which timestamp field captures all changes), soft delete detection mechanisms, and parent-child change propagation gaps. Focus on where the obvious approach silently misses data.
DIMENSION_FOCUS__field_semantics=Identify fields whose standard meaning is overridden or misleading: managed package field overrides (which packages modify which fields and on what schedule), independently editable field pairs, multi-valued fields with org-specific meanings, ISV field interactions
DIMENSION_FOCUS__lifecycle_and_state=Identify state machine behaviors, custom stage progressions, lifecycle boundary conditions (can records regress? skip stages?), record type-specific lifecycle variations, and independently editable state fields
DIMENSION_FOCUS__reconciliation=Identify which numbers should agree between systems but don't, source-of-truth resolution for conflicting data, tolerance levels for discrepancies, and reconciliation procedures
