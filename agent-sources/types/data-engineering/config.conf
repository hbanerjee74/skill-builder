# Focus lines for research sub-agents (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_entities=Focus on pipeline components, table structures, and data lineage relationships.
FOCUS_LINE__research_metrics=Focus on data quality metrics, pipeline SLAs, and load performance measurements.
FOCUS_LINE__research_practices=Focus on transformation patterns (merge, deduplication, late-arriving data), orchestration patterns (dependency graphs, retries, backfill), and common pipeline anti-patterns.
FOCUS_LINE__research_implementation=Focus on historization strategies, load pattern decisions, data quality frameworks, pipeline testing approaches, and schema management across pipeline stages.

# Entity examples (used in research-entities template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for dimensional pipelines: dimensions, fact tables, SCD history, surrogate keys; for incremental loads: watermarks, merge targets, change logs; for streaming: sources, sinks, windows, state stores
