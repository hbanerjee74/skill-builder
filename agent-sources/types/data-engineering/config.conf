# Type configuration for data-engineering agents
NAME_PREFIX=de

# Focus lines for research sub-agents (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_entities=Focus on pipeline components, table structures, and data lineage relationships.
FOCUS_LINE__research_metrics=Focus on data quality metrics, pipeline SLAs, and load performance measurements.
FOCUS_LINE__research_practices=Focus on transformation patterns (merge, deduplication, late-arriving data), orchestration patterns (dependency graphs, retries, backfill), and common pipeline anti-patterns.
FOCUS_LINE__research_implementation=Focus on historization strategies, load pattern decisions, data quality frameworks, pipeline testing approaches, and schema management across pipeline stages.

# Entity examples (used in research-entities template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for dimensional pipelines: dimensions, fact tables, SCD history, surrogate keys; for incremental loads: watermarks, merge targets, change logs; for streaming: sources, sinks, windows, state stores

# Skill type identifier
SKILL_TYPE=data-engineering

# Research dimensions — all spawn in parallel
DIMENSIONS=entities,data-quality,pattern-interactions,load-merge-patterns,historization,layer-design

# Per-dimension focus overrides (optional — omit to use dimension's default focus)
DIMENSION_FOCUS__entities=Entity classification (dimension vs. fact vs. bridge vs. reference), grain decisions per entity, surrogate key strategy, natural key composition, conformed dimension identification
DIMENSION_FOCUS__data_quality=Pattern-specific quality checks (not generic data quality): per-layer validation rules, cross-layer reconciliation accounting for pattern-specific row multiplication, quality gate thresholds, pipeline failure response (halt vs. quarantine vs. continue)
DIMENSION_FOCUS__pattern_interactions=Identify constraint chains between patterns: how SCD type selection constrains merge strategy, how merge strategy constrains key design, how historization choice constrains materialization. Focus on where choosing pattern A forces or precludes pattern B.
DIMENSION_FOCUS__load_merge_patterns=Identify high-water mark column selection, change detection approaches, merge predicate design, idempotency guarantees, failure recovery patterns, backfill strategies for historized data, schema evolution in versioned tables, and orchestration monitoring for pattern-specific drift
DIMENSION_FOCUS__historization=Identify when Type 2 breaks down (>10M rows with 10% daily changes), when snapshots outperform row-versioning (wide tables with many changing columns), when bitemporal modeling is required vs. overkill, and retention policies
DIMENSION_FOCUS__layer_design=Identify where to draw the silver/gold boundary (source-conformed vs. business-conformed silver), physical vs. logical dimension conformance, materialization trade-offs specific to pattern choices (Type 2 dimensions make views expensive), and aggregate table design
