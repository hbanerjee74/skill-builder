# Type configuration for domain agents
NAME_PREFIX=domain

# Focus lines for research sub-agents (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_entities=Focus on business entities, their relationships, cardinality patterns, and cross-functional dependencies specific to the business domain.
FOCUS_LINE__research_metrics=Focus on business KPIs, revenue calculations, and regulatory metrics specific to the business domain.
FOCUS_LINE__research_practices=Focus on business patterns that affect modeling, industry-specific variations, and business rules commonly encoded incorrectly.
FOCUS_LINE__research_implementation=Focus on silver/gold layer modeling patterns, source system field coverage, snapshot strategies, and common modeling mistakes.

# Entity examples (used in research-entities template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for sales: accounts, opportunities, contacts; for supply chain: suppliers, purchase orders, inventory

# Skill type identifier
SKILL_TYPE=domain

# Research dimensions — all spawn in parallel
DIMENSIONS=entities,metrics,business-rules,segmentation-and-periods,modeling-patterns

# Per-dimension focus overrides (optional — omit to use dimension's default focus)
DIMENSION_FOCUS__entities=Business entities, customer hierarchies, organizational relationships, and cross-entity analysis patterns
DIMENSION_FOCUS__metrics=Identify key business metrics, their exact calculation formulas, parameter definitions (denominators, exclusions, modifiers), and where "approximately correct" defaults would produce wrong analysis
DIMENSION_FOCUS__business_rules=Focus on business rules that affect data modeling, industry-specific variations, regulatory constraints, and rules that engineers without domain expertise commonly implement incorrectly
DIMENSION_FOCUS__segmentation_and_periods=Identify specific segmentation breakpoints (not just "segmentation exists"), fiscal calendar structure, snapshot timing, and cross-period rules that constrain metric calculations
DIMENSION_FOCUS__modeling_patterns=Identify domain-specific modeling decisions: grain choices (stage-transition vs. daily-snapshot), field coverage (which source fields to silver vs. gold), and interactions between grain choices and downstream query patterns
