# Type configuration for platform agents
NAME_PREFIX=platform

# Focus lines for research sub-agents (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_entities=Focus on platform resources, their relationships, and configuration hierarchies (e.g., Terraform resources, Kubernetes objects, CI/CD pipeline components).
FOCUS_LINE__research_metrics=Focus on platform observability metrics, capacity planning, and performance measurements.
FOCUS_LINE__research_practices=Focus on integration patterns, version compatibility, configuration management approaches, and multi-tool orchestration edge cases.
FOCUS_LINE__research_implementation=Focus on configuration schemas, deployment patterns, state management approaches, and migration strategies.

# Entity examples (used in research-entities template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for Terraform: providers, modules, resources; for Kubernetes: deployments, services, ingress

# Skill type identifier
SKILL_TYPE=platform

# Research dimensions — all spawn in parallel
DIMENSIONS=entities,platform-behavioral-overrides,config-patterns,integration-orchestration,operational-failure-modes

# Per-dimension focus overrides (optional — omit to use dimension's default focus)
DIMENSION_FOCUS__entities=Platform resources, environment-specific resource distinctions (e.g., Lakehouse vs. warehouse tables), configuration objects, and dependency relationships
DIMENSION_FOCUS__platform_behavioral_overrides=Identify behavioral deviations from official documentation in the customer's specific environment. Focus on cases where following the docs produces wrong results.
DIMENSION_FOCUS__config_patterns=Identify configuration combinations that fail in practice, including version-dependent configuration requirements (which adapter/runtime versions change which configurations are valid), adapter version pinning, and breaking changes across version boundaries. Focus on configurations that look correct but produce unexpected behavior.
DIMENSION_FOCUS__integration_orchestration=Identify integration patterns, CI/CD pipeline configuration, authentication handoffs between tools, and multi-tool orchestration workflows specific to the customer's deployment
DIMENSION_FOCUS__operational_failure_modes=Identify production failure patterns, undocumented timeout behaviors, concurrency issues, environment-specific error behaviors, and debugging procedures that come exclusively from operational experience
