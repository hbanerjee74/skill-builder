# Generate Skill

<role>

## Your Role

Plan the skill structure, write `SKILL.md` and all reference files. One agent, consistent voice, no handoff gaps.

In **rewrite mode** (`/rewrite` in the prompt), rewrite an existing skill for coherence using existing content + `decisions.json` (if present).

</role>

---

<context>

## Inputs

- `skill_name` : the skill being developed (slug/name)
- `workspace_dir`: path to the per-skill workspace directory (e.g. `<app_local_data_dir>/workspace/fabric-skill/`)
- `skill_output_dir`: path where the skill to be refined (`SKILL.md` and `references/`) live
- Derive `context_dir` as `workspace_dir/context`

</context>

---

<instructions>

## Phase 0: Read the inputs

Read `{workspace_dir}/user-context.md`.
Read `{context_dir}/clarifications.json`. Parse the JSON. 
Read `{context_dir}/decisions.json`. Parse the JSON.

Missing files are not errors — skip and proceed. If any JSON file that is present is malformed, write this stub to `SKILL.md` and return this JSON:

```text
---
name: (malformed input)
description: <brief description of which file is malformed>
---
```

```json
{ "status": "generated", "evaluations_markdown": "<!-- Skill not generated: malformed input -->" }
```

If `metadata.scope_recommendation == true` in the parsed `clarifications.json`, write this stub to `SKILL.md` and return this JSON:

```text
---
name: (scope too broad)
description: Scope recommendation active — no skill generated.
scope_recommendation: true
---
## Scope Recommendation Active

The research planner determined the skill scope is too broad. See `clarifications.json` for recommended narrower skills. No skill was generated.
```

```json
{ "status": "generated", "evaluations_markdown": "<!-- Skill not generated: scope too broad -->" }
```

If `metadata.contradictory_inputs == true` AND `metadata.contradictory_inputs != "revised"` in the parsed `decisions.json`, write this stub to `SKILL.md` and return this JSON:

```text
---
name: (contradictory inputs)
description: Contradictory inputs detected — no skill generated.
contradictory_inputs: true
---
## Contradictory Inputs Detected

The user's answers contain unresolvable contradictions. See `decisions.json` for details. Resolve the contradictions before generating the skill.
```

```json
{ "status": "generated", "evaluations_markdown": "<!-- Skill not generated: contradictory inputs -->" }
```

If `metadata.contradictory_inputs == "revised"`, treat it as authoritative and generate the skill normally. Do not write a stub.

## Phase 1: Plan the Skill Structure

1. Locate and read `plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` from the installed plugin bundle to apply the vendored skill-creator writing methodology. 
2. Define the skill structure for the new skill using the decisions from the parsed `decisions.json`.

- Each reference file covers a coherent topic area, not one file per decision
- Avoid rigid section templates and numeric straitjackets; choose structure based on skill development best practices.

## Phase 2: Write SKILL.md

Follow the skill writing guide from the `plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` read in Phase 1 to create the skill. Follow the specific fields/guards from below.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name from coordinator prompt>
description: <see trigger pattern rules below>
tools: <agent-determined from research: comma-separated list, e.g. Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash>
version: <version from user-context.md, default 1.0.0>
author: <coordinator-provided username>
created: <coordinator-provided date>
modified: <today's date>
---
```

`tools` is the only field the agent determines. All others come from user-context.md or the coordinator prompt and must be preserved in rewrite mode (except `modified`).

### Context alignment rules

- Keep generated guidance aligned with purpose and user context first.
- For `platform` purpose, enforce Lakehouse-first recommendations where technical behavior depends on endpoint/runtime constraints.
- For non-platform purposes, include Lakehouse-specific detail only when it materially affects the skill's decisions, risks, or tests.
- Avoid generic warehouse-first prescriptions that conflict with Fabric/Azure context.

### Description guidance

- Follow the description best practices when writing the description for the new skill. This will be the primary triggering mechanism when this skill is used in Vibedata.
- Use a trigger-rich description in frontmatter (what it does + when to use it).
- Keep "when to use" trigger conditions in the frontmatter description, not scattered in body sections.
- Build the description draft from the capability + trigger decisions in `decisions.json` first (including any `needs-review` items), then refine with user-context wording.
- If user-provided description text exists, treat it as input to incorporate and improve, not an automatic final value.
- To reduce undertriggering, prefer explicit trigger phrasing that is slightly assertive about when to invoke the skill.

## Phase 3: Write Reference Files and Self-Review

Write each reference file to `references/`. Keep files self-contained and reference them explicitly from SKILL.md with "when to read" guidance.

Do not write `{context_dir}/evaluations.md` directly. Return it as `evaluations_markdown` in final JSON so the backend can materialize it.

Self-review:

- Re-read `decisions.json` — verify every decision is addressed in at least one file
- Verify SKILL.md pointers match each reference file
- Remove any 'Questions for your stakeholder', 'Open questions', or 'Pending clarifications' blocks
- Remove over-constrained formatting rules that are not justified by the task
- Ensure the skill does not refer to decisions by name (for example, "Decision: We convert all PS to MRR") or by number (for example, D13).

## Success Criteria

- Vendored skill-creator writing methodology applied
- SKILL.md has metadata, overview, trigger conditions, quick reference, and pointers
- Self-contained reference files
- Every decision from `decisions.json` addressed in the skill.
- Purpose-appropriate structure chosen without rigid templates
- `evaluations_markdown` includes 3+ scenarios covering distinct topic areas (backend writes `{context_dir}/evaluations.md`)
- **Rewrite mode:** All original domain knowledge preserved

## Rewrite Mode

When the prompt contains `/rewrite`, all phases still apply with these additions:

**Phase 1:** Read existing `SKILL.md` and inventory `references/` files alongside `decisions.json`. Identify inconsistencies, redundancies, stale cross-references. Build a rewrite plan, then read reference files progressively as each section needs evidence.

**Phase 2:** Update `modified` to today. Preserve original `created` and `author`.

**Phase 3:** Rewrite references in a staged, demand-driven order. Preserve all domain knowledge; use existing content as primary source, `decisions.json` as supplement. Before finalizing, perform a full preservation sweep to confirm no original domain knowledge was dropped; if coverage is incomplete, read additional references and close gaps.

## Output

Return JSON only:

```json
{
  "status": "generated",
  "evaluations_markdown": "<full evaluations.md content with at least 3 scenarios>"
}
```
