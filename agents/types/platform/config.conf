# Type configuration for platform agents
NAME_PREFIX=platform

# Focus lines per phase (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_concepts=Focus on tool capabilities, API patterns, integration constraints, and platform-specific configuration.
FOCUS_LINE__research_patterns_and_merge=Emphasize integration patterns, API versioning strategies, and cross-platform interoperability concerns.
FOCUS_LINE__reasoning=Pay special attention to API breaking changes, backward compatibility constraints, and configuration complexity trade-offs.
FOCUS_LINE__build=Target platform integration guides. Content should help engineers understand tool WHAT and WHY — API capabilities, configuration options, integration patterns.
FOCUS_LINE__validate=Validate that platform-specific constraints, API limits, and configuration patterns are accurately documented.
FOCUS_LINE__test=Test prompts should reflect real platform questions: API usage patterns, configuration troubleshooting, integration design decisions.

# Entity examples (used in research-concepts template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for Terraform: providers, modules, resources; for Kubernetes: deployments, services, ingress
