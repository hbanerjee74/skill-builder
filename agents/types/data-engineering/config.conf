# Type configuration for data-engineering agents
NAME_PREFIX=de

# Focus lines per phase (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_concepts=Focus on pipeline architecture patterns, transformation logic, data quality rules, orchestration patterns, and infrastructure considerations.
FOCUS_LINE__research_patterns_and_merge=Emphasize pipeline design patterns, orchestration strategies, data quality frameworks, and performance optimization techniques.
FOCUS_LINE__reasoning=Pay special attention to pipeline reliability trade-offs, idempotency requirements, and data quality vs. latency decisions.
FOCUS_LINE__build=Target pipeline implementation guides. Content should help engineers understand pipeline WHAT and WHY — orchestration patterns, transformation logic, quality rules.
FOCUS_LINE__validate_and_test=Focus on pipeline architecture patterns, transformation logic, data quality rules, orchestration patterns, and infrastructure considerations.

# Entity examples (used in research-concepts template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for batch pipelines: stages, checkpoints, transformations; for streaming: sources, sinks, windows
