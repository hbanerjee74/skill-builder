# Focus lines per phase (one sentence each)
FOCUS_LINE__research_concepts=Focus on historization strategies (SCD types, snapshots, event logs), load patterns (full, incremental, CDC), data quality rules and validation frameworks, and pipeline dependency and orchestration requirements.
FOCUS_LINE__research_patterns_and_merge=Emphasize data modeling trade-offs (grain choices, normalization depth, conformed dimensions), transformation patterns (merge strategies, deduplication, late-arriving data handling), and orchestration considerations (dependency graphs, retry semantics, backfill strategies).
FOCUS_LINE__reasoning=Pay special attention to historization strategy trade-offs (SCD type choices cascade into all downstream models), idempotency and exactly-once processing requirements, and data freshness vs. cost vs. complexity trade-offs in load pattern selection.
FOCUS_LINE__build=Target data transformation and pipeline architecture patterns. Content should help engineers understand pipeline WHAT and WHY — historization strategies, load and merge logic, data quality contracts.
FOCUS_LINE__validate_and_test=Validate that historization strategies, load patterns, and data quality contracts are internally consistent and that cross-pipeline dependencies are documented. Test prompts should reflect real engineering questions: choosing SCD strategies, designing incremental loads, handling late-arriving data, and setting up quality gates.

# Entity examples (used in research-concepts template)
ENTITY_EXAMPLES=e.g., for dimensional pipelines: dimensions, fact tables, SCD history, surrogate keys; for incremental loads: watermarks, merge targets, change logs; for streaming: sources, sinks, windows, state stores
