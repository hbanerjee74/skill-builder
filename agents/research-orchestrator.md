# Research Orchestrator

Run the research phase of the Skill Builder workflow.

## Inputs

- `purpose`: the full label (e.g. "Business process knowledge")
- `context_dir`: path to the context directory (e.g. `./fabric-skill/context/`)
- `workspace_dir`: path to the per-skill workspace directory (e.g. `.vibedata/skill-builder/fabric-skill/`)

## Step 0: Read user context

Read `{workspace_dir}/user-context.md`. Pass the full content to the research skill under a `## User Context` heading. If missing, return an error.

## Step 1: Run the research skill as a sub-agent

Spawn a Task sub-agent with this prompt:

---
**DO NOT write any files. Return all output as inline text only.**

Use the research skill to research dimensions and produce clarifications for:

- purpose: {purpose value from user-context.md}

Purpose-aware lens:

- Prioritize the selected purpose dimension set first.
- If purpose is `platform`, enforce Lakehouse-first constraints explicitly.
- For other purposes (`business process`, `source`, `data-engineering`), include Lakehouse constraints only when they materially change design, risk, or validation.
- Avoid generic warehouse guidance that conflicts with Fabric/Azure context.

## User Context

{full user-context.md content from Step 0 — pass the complete file content here}

---

Capture the full tool result as `research_output`.

## Step 2: Write output files

`research_output` must be a single JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "research_plan_markdown": "<complete canonical research-plan.md content>",
  "clarifications_json": { "...": "valid clarifications object" }
}
```

**Your only actions are two Write calls. Do not echo or repeat the file contents in your response.**

1. Write `research_plan_markdown` verbatim → `{context_dir}/research-plan.md`
2. Serialize `clarifications_json` as pretty JSON (`2` spaces) → `{context_dir}/clarifications.json`

Verify both files exist by reading the first 5 lines of each. If either is missing or empty, retry once.

`research-plan.md` must be canonical:

- YAML frontmatter with: `purpose`, `domain`, `topic_relevance`, `dimensions_evaluated`, `dimensions_selected`
- `## Dimension Scores` section with a markdown table
- `## Selected Dimensions` section with a markdown table

If the extracted research plan is only a loose dimension table (without canonical frontmatter/sections), retry Step 1 with an explicit correction request and overwrite `research-plan.md` with the corrected canonical output.

## Step 3: Check scope recommendation

Read `{context_dir}/clarifications.json`. If `metadata.scope_recommendation` is `true`, stop and return:

```json
{
  "status": "research_complete",
  "dimensions_selected": 0,
  "question_count": 0
}
```

## Step 4: Return

Return JSON only (no markdown) with this shape:

```json
{
  "status": "research_complete",
  "dimensions_selected": 0,
  "question_count": 0
}
```
