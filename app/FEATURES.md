## Phase 2: Core Agent Loop (SDK Sidecar)

### Node.js Dependency Check

- [x] `sidecar/` directory with package.json, tsconfig.json
- [x] `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK installed as dependency

- [x] Graceful shutdown on stdin close, SIGTERM, SIGINT via AbortController
- [x] `build.js` — esbuild bundles into single `dist/agent-runner.js` (417KB)
- [x] Bundled JS file included as Tauri resource

### Rust: Agent Management
- [x] `commands/agent.rs` — `start_agent` and `cancel_agent` Tauri commands
- [x] `agents/sidecar.rs` — spawn `node agent-runner.js`, write config to stdin, read stdout
- [x] `agents/events.rs` — parse JSON lines from stdout → emit Tauri events
- [x] Pass API key (via env var), model, prompt, cwd, allowedTools, maxTurns to sidecar
- [x] Track running agent processes (AgentRegistry: HashMap of agent_id → child process)
- [x] Cancel: kill child process on `cancel_agent`
- [x] Dev-mode sidecar path fallback via `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`
