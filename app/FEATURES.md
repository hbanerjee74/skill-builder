## Phase 2: Core Agent Loop (SDK Sidecar)

### Node.js Dependency Check

- [x] `sidecar/` directory with package.json, tsconfig.json
- [x] `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK installed as dependency

### Rust: Agent Management
- [x] `commands/agent.rs` — `start_agent` and `cancel_agent` Tauri commands
- [x] `agents/sidecar.rs` — spawn `node agent-runner.js`, write config to stdin, read stdout
- [x] `agents/events.rs` — parse JSON lines from stdout → emit Tauri events
- [x] Pass API key (via env var), model, prompt, cwd, allowedTools, maxTurns to sidecar
- [x] Track running agent processes (AgentRegistry: HashMap of agent_id → child process)
- [x] Cancel: kill child process on `cancel_agent`
- [x] Dev-mode sidecar path fallback via `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`

- [x] Frontend: Form submission → serialize back to exact markdown format
- [x] Step 1 end-to-end: view questions as form → answer → save to file
