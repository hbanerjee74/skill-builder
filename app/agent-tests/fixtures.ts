# Pet Store Analytics

This skill guides data engineers in building dbt models for pet store analytics domains.

## Core Entities
- dim_products — product hierarchy (department, category, SKU)
- dim_customers — customer profiles with segmentation
- fct_sales — transaction grain with line items
- fct_inventory — daily inventory snapshots

## Quick Reference

| Entity | Key Metrics | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Products | revenue, units_sold | SKU-level |
| Customers | ltv, frequency_tier | Segmented |
| Sales | gmv, aov | Transaction grain |
| Inventory | days_on_hand, fill_rate | Daily snapshot |
