    "## Researching Domain Concepts\n\nI'll start by identifying the key terminology, frameworks, and mental models used in this domain. Let me search for authoritative sources.",
    "### Key Findings\n\nI've identified several core concepts:\n\n1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** — Bounded contexts, aggregates, and ubiquitous language\n2. **Event Sourcing** — Capturing state changes as immutable events\n3. **CQRS** — Separating read and write models for scalability",
    "### Generating Clarification Questions\n\nBased on my research, I need to understand your specific context better. I'm preparing a set of targeted questions about how these concepts apply to your use case."
