# Research Clarifications

## Section 1: Core Concepts

### Q1: What is the primary use case for this skill?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Focus on the most common workflow patterns that engineers encounter daily
- [ ] b) Focus on advanced/niche patterns for experienced engineers
- [ ] c) Cover both common and advanced patterns with equal depth
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Focus on the most common workflow patterns that engineers encounter daily.

**Answer:**

### Q2: What level of expertise should this skill assume?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Beginner — needs step-by-step guidance on fundamentals
- [ ] b) Intermediate — familiar with basic concepts but needs guidance on best practices and edge cases
- [ ] c) Advanced — already knows best practices, needs deep domain-specific insight
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Intermediate — familiar with basic concepts but needs guidance on best practices and edge cases.

**Answer:**

### Q3: Should this skill cover both greenfield and brownfield scenarios?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Greenfield only — new projects from scratch
- [ ] b) Both, with emphasis on greenfield but include migration guidance for existing systems
- [ ] c) Both with equal depth
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Yes, with emphasis on greenfield but include migration guidance for existing systems.

**Answer:**

## Section 2: Architecture & Design

### Q4: What architectural patterns should be prioritized?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Start with the most widely adopted patterns, then layer in alternatives for specific constraints
- [ ] b) Cover all patterns equally and let the reader choose
- [ ] c) Focus on opinionated best-practice patterns only
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Start with the most widely adopted patterns, then layer in alternatives for specific constraints.

**Answer:**

### Q5: How should the skill handle technology-specific vs technology-agnostic guidance?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Lead with technology-agnostic principles, then provide concrete examples for the most common tools
- [ ] b) Organize entirely by technology/tool
- [ ] c) Technology-agnostic only — no tool-specific examples
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Lead with technology-agnostic principles, then provide concrete examples for the most common tools.

**Answer:**

### Q6: Should performance optimization be covered in the main skill or references?

**Choices**:
- [ ] a) Cover key performance principles in SKILL.md, detailed optimization in references
- [ ] b) All performance content in references only
- [ ] c) Inline performance guidance alongside each pattern
- [ ] Other (please specify)

**Recommendation:** Cover key performance principles in SKILL.md, detailed optimization in references.

**Answer:**

## Section 3: Implementation Details

### Q7: What level of code examples should be included?

**Choices**:
